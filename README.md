3. **Data Transformation:** Applied necessary transformations such as pivoting, unpivoting, and type casting to ensure consistency.
4. **Modeling and Relationships:** Established relationships between different tables and datasets to enable comprehensive analysis.

## Types of Visualizations Used

1. **Sankey Diagram:**
2. **Chord Diagram:** 
3. **Map Visualizations (Map, Shape Map):** 
4. **Area Chart:**
5. **Treemap:** 
6. **Table:**
7. **Funnel Chart:**
8. **Stacked Column Chart:**
9. **Donut Chart**
10. **Clustered Bar Chart**
11. **Line and Clustered Column Chart**

## Explanation of some Visualizations

1. **Sankey Diagram:** 
   - **Explanation:** This diagram showcases the flow of car sales from different body styles to various engine types, highlighting the volume of sales at each stage.

2. **Chord Diagram:** 
   - **Explanation:** This diagram demonstrates the connections between car body styles and their color preferences, providing insights into the relationship between these attributes and their sales prices.

3. **Map Visualizations (Map, Shape Map):** 
   - **Explanation:** These maps depict the geographical distribution of car sales, identifying key regions with high or low sales volumes through bubble sizes representing total sales year-to-date.

4. **Area Chart:** 
   - **Explanation:** This chart illustrates the temporal trends in car sales prices over weeks, helping to identify peak sales periods and seasonal patterns.

5. **Treemap:** 
   - **Explanation:** Presents the market share of different manufacturers, offering a visual comparison of their relative performance.

6. **Table:** 
   - **Explanation:** Displays detailed sales records and performance metrics, providing a granular view of the data.

7. **Funnel Chart:** 
   - **Explanation:** Visualizes the stages of the sales process, showing where potential sales are lost and where conversion rates can be improved.

8. **Stacked Column Chart:** 
   - **Explanation:** Compares sales volumes across different categories such as car models, regions, and time periods.

## Advanced Features

1. **Filtering:** Applied both page-level and report-level filters to drill down into specific subsets of data for more detailed analysis.
2. **Date/Period Grouping:** Created custom date groups to analyze sales patterns over different time frames (monthly, quarterly, yearly).
3. **Interactive Dashboards:** Designed multiple interactive dashboards where visual elements interact with each other to provide a cohesive analysis experience.
4. **Slicers:** Used slicers to enable users to filter data dynamically based on specific criteria such as region, car model, and time period.
5. **Drill-Through Techniques:** Implemented drill-through functionality to navigate between different levels of data granularity, allowing for detailed insights.
6. **Hierarchy and Drill-Down/Up:** Utilized hierarchical structures to enable drill-down and drill-up capabilities in visualizations for more in-depth analysis.
7. **Custom Measures:** Created custom measures and quick measures using DAX to calculate specific metrics such as total sales, average sales price, and growth rates.
8. **KPI Visualizations:** Developed Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to track and visualize critical metrics such as sales targets, performance against benchmarks, and market trends.
